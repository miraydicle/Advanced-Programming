# **Data Structures in C++**

This folder contains implementations of fundamental **data structures** in C++, demonstrating efficient and optimized approaches to managing data. Each implementation is structured with clean code, proper documentation, and example use cases.

## **Implemented Data Structures**

### **1. AVL Tree Search Engine**
- Implements an **AVL tree**, a self-balancing binary search tree.
- Used for **fast word retrieval and frequency tracking** across multiple documents.
- Supports case-insensitive word storage and efficient searching.
- Example operations:
  - Insert words from text files into the AVL tree.
  - Search for words and return the count in each document.

**Folder:** `AVL_Tree_Search_Engine/`

### **2. Stack-Based Salesman Path Tracking**
- Implements a **custom stack** to track the travel path of a salesman.
- Features **time-travel mechanics** that allow the salesman to instantly return to previously visited cities.
- Only uses **a stack data structure** for traversal (no additional data structures allowed).
- Reads input from a file containing city coordinates and prints the travel path dynamically.
