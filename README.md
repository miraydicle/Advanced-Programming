# **Advanced C++ Programming**

This repository contains advanced C++ implementations covering various topics, including data structures, memory management, operator overloading, multithreading, and algorithmic problem-solving. The code is structured, efficient, and well-documented for clarity and maintainability.

## **Features**
- **Dynamic Memory Management** – Smart pointers, RAII, and efficient resource handling
- **Data Structures** – Linked lists, stacks, queues, and custom data structures
- **Operator Overloading** – Implementing custom behaviors for C++ operators
- **Multithreading & Concurrency** – Synchronization techniques and parallel computing
- **Algorithmic Problem-Solving** – Efficient solutions to complex computational challenges

## **Getting Started**
### **Prerequisites**
- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2012**  
- **C++ Compiler (MSVC)**  

### **Setup & Build (Visual Studio 2012)**
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Advanced-CPP.git
   cd Advanced-CPP
   ```
2. Open **Visual Studio 2012** and create a new C++ project.  
3. Add the necessary `.cpp` and `.h` files to the project.  
4. Configure the project settings:
   - **C++ Language Standard**: C++11  
   - **Character Set**: Use Multi-Byte Character Set (if needed)  
   - **Optimization**: Enable `/O2` for release builds  
5. Build and run the project via **Ctrl + F5**.
